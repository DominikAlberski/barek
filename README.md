# Alcohol cabinet plus coctails

This app was created at Coders lab bootcamp as an end projekt.

It's a database app wchich alows users to create and store information about difrent kinds off alcohols. 

It also alows user to check what kind of coctails could be made from alcohol in current user collection. Users can add, edit and delete alcohols and coctails they created but they can't change other user coctails or alcohols.

change coctail index similar to alcohol index
