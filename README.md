# Alcohol cabinet plus coctails

This app was created at Coders lab bootcamp as an end projekt.

It's a database app wchich alows users to create and store information about difrent kinds off alcohols. 

It also alows user to check what kind of coctails could be made from alcohol. Users can add, edit and delete alcohols and coctails they created, but they can't change other user coctails or alcohols.

Core functionalitys are done but application is still under develop.

Things to do:

edit alcohol JS update to show filds for current alcohol kind

update alcohol action

edit coctail action

when creating an alcohol user shuld not be able to crete 2 difrent kinds of alcohols for 1 alcohol

change alcohol index to show only curent user alcohols when user is sign in with option to see all alcohols

change coctail index similar to alcohol index (?)

add posibility for coping other users alcohols / coctails

add option for comments on coctails
